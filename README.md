A simple game, powered by an Arduino, to play on a Nextion touch screen. You have 90 seconds to get as many cookies as you can! Modeled after the online game on http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/.

To run the Arduino code, first include the nextion-master library, which was taken from https://github.com/bborncr/nextion.
